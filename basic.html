                    <h3>Tucson's most effective dog training</h3>
                    <p>
                        Complete obedience training at our 5-acre ranch. In just 14 days, we can train your dog in complete basic obedience. We do all the work, you attend 3 follow-up lessons. Call for details. All dogs must have up-to-date vaccinations.

                    <p>Our basic obedience course includes the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HEELING - Your dog will walk on your left side with his head aligned with your left leg. He will not pull you or lag behind. When you stop walking, he will sit automatically without being asked. This sit is considered permanent. Your dog may not leave the sit unless he is released from the command or commanded to heel again.</li>
                        <li>
                            RECALL - Your dog will come to you on command (hand signal, verbal, or both). He will do this as fast as he is
                            physically able to, even under heavy distraction, and sit down in front of you, facing you. This sit is also considered
                            permanent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            SIT - Your dog will sit on command, verbal, hand signal or both. This a permanent command.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            DOWN - Your dog will down at your side with hand signals, verbal command or both. This is also a permanent command.
                        </li>

                            PLACEMAT - This involves a blanket, towel, or dog bed. You point and say "place". Your dog may sit, stand or lay on the
                            placemat, but cannot take more than 2 paws off the mat.
                        </li>

                            DOOR MANNERS - We will teach your dog to greet your house guests politely. No jumping, growling or biting.
