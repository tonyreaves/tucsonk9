                <h2>Unlock your dog's full potential</h2>
                <p>
                  In addition to basic obedience, we offer
                  <a name="advancedObedience">advanced courses</a> for pets and
                  working dogs. We gladly provide references and are proud to
                  include The Tucson Police Department K-9 Unit as one of our
                  satisfied clients. Call for a free evaluation and see if your
                  dog is a good fit for advanced training.

                    <h3>Advanced obedience</h3>
                    Advanced obedience picks up where basic obedience ends. Your
                    dog will learn to reliably heel without a leash as well as
                    run and jog with you. He'll learn the "stand" and "finish"
                    commands, along with beginner agility and scent detection
                    games. Advanced obedience is designed to challenge your dog
                    mentally and physically to enrich his life and yours and to
                    foster deeper communication between the two of you. Watch a
                    video of off-leash outdoor training
                    <a href="videos.html#offLeash" class="link">here</a>.

                    <h3>Service dog training</h3>
                    Service dog training is customized to the individual client.
                    Your physical condition is different from everyone else's.
                    At Tucson K-9, we can teach your dog to perform almost any
                    service you require. Please call us for more information.

                    <h3>Therapy dog training</h3>
                    We work with several nursing homes and hospices in our
                    Therapy dog course. Not all dogs have the temperament to
                    enter this course, but if they do, bringing comfort to the
                    sick and terminally ill is incredibly rewarding for both dog
                    and owner. Make your dog someone's hero!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h3>Scent/narcotics detection</h3>
                    Dogs have incredible noses. Some studies suggest that their
                    sense of smell may be up to 100,000 times more sensitive
                    than a human's. Tucson K-9 can teach your dog to identify
                    and indicate for narcotics and explosives or just help you
                    find your car keys! Watch a video of a narcotics detection
                    dog in training
                    <a href="videos.html#scent" class="link">here</a>.

                  <li>
                    <h3>Tracking and trailing</h3>
                    More nose work! tracking and trailing games are very
                    popular. They're a great way to exercise your dog's body and
                    mind at the same time. Maybe you'd like to volunteer your
                    time to your local search and rescue organization. Either
                    way, it's great for team-building with your best friend.

                    <h3>Attack dog training</h3>
                    We've trained personal protection dogs from all over
                    Arizona. Our training is based on military K-9 methods, and
                    our dogs respond with military precision. Watch videos of an
                    attack dog we've trained

                    We can train your dog to bring your medication, your
                    newspaper or just a beer from the fridge. Watch a dog we
